REPORT--------------------------

        From both the tables we can observe that merge sort is faster than insertion sort
        because in merge sort time complexicity is of O(nlogn) where as its O(n*n) in insertion.

        Now but in insertion sort the number of comparisons of ascending < desecending as it takes 
        each element to check its previous element .so thereby by, for  random the value of COMPARISIONS
        is intermidiate as predicted by results

        But in merge sort the case is completely different, the number of comparisons of ascending > desecending
        as in the time of merging, the comparision step in descending takes less steps because of immidiate 
        termination of "loop1" and jump into loop2 because of the shift of all elements of array2 into original array.
        Where as in random the pattern is not as nice or predictable ,so the no. of comparisions is greater than both 
        of them as we got above in our table.
