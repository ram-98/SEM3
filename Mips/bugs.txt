        Bugs happen quite a many times in software but rare in hardware .Few of the hardware bugs are Intel Skylake bug,TSX bug, Pentium FDIV bug etc...
Now lets take an use case example of Pentium FDIV bug.

----------->DETECTION

                    Many of the processor bugs are accidentally detected , depending on its purpose as used by consumers.The company takes all the steps 
for bugs not to occur .So when Thomas Nicely, a professor of mathematics , tried some calculations using this , got errors.Then he reported this to Intel
 and other contacts .This way this bug  was detected.
             He gave a simple method to detect the flawed pentinum,
                            4195835.0/3145727.0 = 1.333 820 449 136 241 002 (Correct value)
                            4195835.0/3145727.0 = 1.333 739 068 902 037 589 (Value returned by flawed Pentium)
                                                                (These values are taken from wikipedia)

------------>FIXATION

                    As its a pure manufacturing defect ,its easy to fix the big by correcting the flaw in it.As in this case, Intel decided to use SRT
 algorithm to increase the execution speed of Floating Point Operations(FPU).This method uses a lookup table which contains 1066 table entries.But due to 
 a programming error five of them  were not included.When any of these five are fetched by the floating point unit (FPU), it gives incorrect results.
                    Intel fixed it and all the processors which are built from 1995 are free from it.

------------>HOW INTEL DEALT WITH it

                        This flaw soon spread over internet, press, news channels and the company is heavily criticized .Even IBM, its competetor joined them.
 Intel dealt with it by saying that most common users wont affect by this and they promised to replace all of the flawed processors which caused trouble .
 But due to huge pressure ,it decided to all of them if their constomers are willing so.

 ----------->COST OF FIXING

                        Needless to say many millon dollars are spend on replacement .Even IBM stopped shippments of the computers with flawed chip.
In general the cost depends on compelexity of the bug.Here as it didnt effect most users its quite low .Otherwise if most of them have come for replacement
then it have been a severe issue to the company.
