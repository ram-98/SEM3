----	The Design of the program is as follows

	-->>>>You need to give space after each word and comma's must be included with the previous word itself 
		as ($t0,) and not space must be there between comma and word ,for the simulator to execute 
		
	-->>>>Immediate(addi etc) operations doesnt take the value '0' as  immediate and you should use $zero for that 
		in non-immediate operations (add etc) 
	
	--->>>>Any syntax error in the program is reported by the simulator as prescribed by sir, and segmentation fault
		etc.. are not mentioned by the simulator as sir didnt ask us to do that  and you need to
		 take proper care of that .
		
	---->>>My program also implements an extra instruction 'la' which is not mentioned in the question.
		This is for the purpose of demonstration of lw, sw
			
	--->>>>There are there sample assembly programs along with the source code
		
		1.First one is the program which gives maximum of an array of 5 elements in $t3(TUTORIAL PROBLEM 1) 
			The array is declared at the starting and you can change the values in the program to the output 
			in $t3.
			
		2.Second one contains general instructions with lw, sw , la with 3 arrays declared above .
		
		3.Third one contains instructions for logical , arthemetic and controlflow statements
	
	----->>>The output of the program is the status of all registers and memory allocated with the simulated memory
		address.
